              To ensure your child is most comfortable while taking the test I make it convenient by coming to your home to administer the test. We can also schedule the test at a local library or other location if requested.

              Quite Working Space
            </summary>
              We will need a quite working space (table and chair). Access for your child to a snack and drink is helpful too. I make sure to take as many breaks as your child needs as I want to ensure we allow their inner genius to shine. As to not disturb your child please have any siblings stay in another room or arrange for them to be entertained while testing takes place.

            I ask for 1-2 weeks to prepare the final test result and issue a signed final PDF report. There is an option to expedite the result to 3 business days with a $50 convenience fee.
